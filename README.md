Project using HTML to create a recipe webpage.

Hello Toliver (or future people, I guess, but why are you here?)

This is an assignment for The Odin Project where I'll create a webpage for recipes. For the sake of convenience, I copied the exact assignment description from The Odin Project, which I will paste below.

"It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS."


Toodaloo!
